Controller: feedforward-plus-P controller
Feedback Gains: Kp=2.2, Ki=0
Initial Configuration: config_initial = np.array([np.pi/10,-0.5,0.5,np.pi/10,-np.pi/10,-np.pi/10,-np.pi/10,0,0,0,0,0,0]).reshape(1,13)

In this best condition, I just tried the Kp from 2 and I choose 2.2 since the overshoot is small and the error is small.
